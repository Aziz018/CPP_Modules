## Why << Cannot Be a Member Function? (Why You Can't Overload `<<` as a Member Function?)

Member functions in C++ always take the calling object (the object on the left of the operator) as an implicit parameter. If you try to define `operator<<` as a member function of your class, the calling object will be your class (on the left of the `<<` operator), which doesn't make sense, because the left operand should be `std::ostream`.

## Why the Left Operand Matters?

The `<<` operator expects the left operand to be of type `std::ostream`. If you try to make `<<` a member function of your class, the left operand will be your class type , not `std::ostream`, which breaks the expected behavior.

## The Correct Way: Non-Member Function
The correct approach is to define the `<<` operator **outside the class** as a **non-member function**. This way, you can specify that the first operand (`std::ostream`) is the left-hand side, and your class object is the right-hand side.
